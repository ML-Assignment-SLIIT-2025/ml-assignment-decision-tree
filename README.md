# Decision Tree

## Overview
This notebook trains, tunes, and evaluates a Decision Tree classifier to predict customer churn using preprocessed data from the Telco Customer Churn dataset. It includes initial model training, hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`, and performance evaluation with metrics and visualizations.

## Objectives
- Train a Decision Tree model on preprocessed data.
- Optimize hyperparameters for improved performance.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve.
- Analyze feature importance.

## Dataset
- **Input Files**: 
  - `X_preprocessed.csv` (features)
  - `y_preprocessed.csv` (target)
- **Source**: Generated by the "Data Analysis and Preprocessing" notebook.
- **Features**: Preprocessed with encoding, scaling, and SMOTEENN resampling.
- **Target**: `Churn` (binary: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Load preprocessed `X_preprocessed.csv` and `y_preprocessed.csv`.
2. **Data Splitting**: Split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
3. **Initial Model**: Train a Decision Tree with basic parameters (`max_depth=6`, `min_samples_leaf=8`).
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use `GridSearchCV` to optimize `criterion`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `min_samples_leaf`.
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Compute accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Plot confusion matrix and ROC curve.
   - Visualize top 10 feature importances.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `sklearn` (for `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `GridSearchCV`, metrics)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
- Ensure X_preprocessed.csv and y_preprocessed.csv are uploaded to Google Colab or your local environment.
- Run the notebook to train and evaluate the Decision Tree model.

## Outputs
- Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for initial and tuned models.
- Visualizations: Confusion matrices, feature importance bar plot, ROC curve.
